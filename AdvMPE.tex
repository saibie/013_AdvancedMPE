\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

We consider a matrix polynomial equation(MPE) with $n$-degree defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MPE}
P(X)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} A_{k}X^{k}= A_{n}X^{n}+A_{n-1}X^{n-1}+\cdots+A_{1}X + A_{0}=0,
\end{equation}
where the coefficient matrices $A_{k}$'s are $\mbym$ matrices.
Then, the unknown matrix $X$ must be an $\mbym$ matrix.


The MPE \eqref{eq:MPE} often occurs in the theory of differential equations, system theory, network theory, stochastic theory, quasi-birth-and-death
and other areas \cite{ALFA2003, Bean1997, Butler1985, Gohberg1982, Lancaster1966, Lancaster1985, He2001, bini2005, Latouche1999}.
Specially, in quasi-birth-and-death and stochastic problems, finding the minimal nonnegative solution of a matrix equation is an important issue.

There are many researches to find the minimal nonnegative solution.
%Davis \cite{Davis1981, Davis1983} and Higham, Kim \cite{Higham2000, Higham2001} studied the Newton method for a quadratic matrix equation.
Guo and Laub \cite{Guo2000} considered a nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equation, and they proposed iteration algorithms which converge to the minimal positive solution. 
In \cite{Guo2001}, Guo provided a sufficient condition for the existence of nonnegative solutions of nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations.
Kim \cite{Kim2008} showed that the minimal positive solutions also can be found by the Newton method with the zero initial matrices in some different types of quadratic equations.
%Hautphenne, Latouche, and Remiche \cite{SophieHautphenne2008} studied the Newton method for the Markovian binary tree.
Seo and Kim \cite{SeoSeoKim2013, SeoKim2014} studied the Newton iteration for a quadratic matrix equation and a matrix polynomial equation.

Newton's method is one of powerful tools to find a solution of a nonlinear matrix equation.
It is well-known that the convergence rate of the method is quadratic in many cases by Kantrovich theorem \cite{Kantorovich1964}.
But, if the derivative at the solution is singular, then we cannot apply Kantrovich theorem.
The followings are researches to analyze the problems with singular derivative at the solution and improve the method.

For general functions on Banach spaces, Reddien \cite{Reddien1978}, Decker and Kelley \cite{DeckerKelley1980Newton1, DeckerKelley1980Newton2} gave analyses about Newton's method for singular problems.
In \cite{DeckerKellerKelley1983}, Decker, Keller, and Kelley provided an acceleration of Newton's method for singular problems and analyzed for the convergence rate of the method.
Kelley and Suresh \cite{Kelley1983} suggested a new accelerated Newton's method at singular points.
Decker and Kelley \cite{DeckerKelley1985} showed an analysis for Newton's method
at nearly singular roots.
In \cite{Kelley1986}, Kelley analyzed convergence rate of the method for functions whose high order derivatives at the solution are singular.
For specific functions on $\R^{\mbyn}$, Guo and Lancaster \cite{Guo1998M} analyzed and provided a modification about Newton's method for algebraic Riccati equations at singular roots.
In \cite{SeoSeo2020}, Seo S-.H. and Seo J-.H. suggested a modified Newton method for matrix polynomial equations with $n$-degree for singular problems.

We give some basic definitions and lemmas for this paper.

Let $A, B \in \R^{\mbym}$ be matrices.
If all elements of $A$ is nonnegative, then we call that $A$ is a {\it nonnegative} matrix and denote $A \geq 0$. In similar sense, we define $A \leq 0$, $A > 0$, and $A < 0$.
If a matrix $A$ can be written as $rI-B$ with $B \geq 0$ and $r \in \R$, we call that $A$ is a \textit{$Z$-matrix}.
Moreover, if $A=rI-B$ is a $Z$-matrix and $r\geq\rho(B)$ then $A$ is called an $M$-matrix.
The following is a basic theorem for $M$-matrices.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:proMmat}%{\rm \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Guo2007}, \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Poole1974}}
	For a $Z$-matrix $A$, the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A$ is a nonsingular $M$-matrix.
		
		\item $A^{-1}$ is nonnegative.
		
		\item $Av>0$ for some vector $v>0$.
		
		\item All eigenvalues of $A$ have positive real parts.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Let a function $F : \R^{\mbyn} \rightarrow \R^{\mbyn}$ and an equation $F(X) = 0$ be given.

If nonnegative solutions $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ of $F(X) = 0$ are satisfy
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:s1ss2}
	S_{1}\leq S\leq S_{2},\end{equation}
for any nonnegative solution $S$ of $F(X) = 0$, then they are called the {\it minimal nonnegative solution} and the {\it maximal nonnegative solution}, respectively.
The {\it minimal positive solution} and the {\it maximal positive solution} also are can be defined, similarly.

If the Fr\'echet derivative of $F$ at a solution $S$ is nonsingular, then $S$ is called {\it simple}.
Furthermore, we call that a not simple solution is {\it non-simple}.

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:MPE}
	For the MPE \eqref{eq:MPE},
	\begin{enumerate}[1)]
		\item The coefficient matrices $A_{k}$'s are nonnegative except $A_{1}$.
		\item $-A_{1}$ is a nonsingular $M$-matrix.
		\item $\sum_{k=0}^{n}A_{k}$ is irreducible.
		\item $A_{0}$, $A_{1}$, and $\sum_{k=2}^{n}A_{k}$ are irreducible.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}



Aim of this paper is to provide an improved Newton's method for \eqref{eq:MPE}.

%This MPE is useful for stochastic theory, quasi-birth-and-death problem, and so on.
%In \cite{Guo1998M}, Guo and Lancaster showed that $\|Y_{i+1} - S\| < c\varepsilon$ 
%for the modified iteration $Y_{i+1}$, the solution $S$, a constant $c > 0$, and small $\varepsilon > 0$.
%Similarily, Seo, Seo, and Kim \cite{SeoSeoKim2018} showed that the modified Newton iteration $Y_{i+1}$ for the MPE is closer to the solution $S$ than
%the pure Newton iteration $X_{i+1}$.
%But, in both of \cite{Guo1998M, SeoSeoKim2018}, the authors showed that the modifications are better than the pure if the solution $S$ is non-simple.


For convenience, the notation $||\,\cdot\,||$ is used instead of the Frobenius norm $||\,\cdot\,||_{F}$
and $\N_{0}$ is used as $\N \cup \{0\}$ because the Frobenius norm and $\N_{0}$ are used very frequently in this paper.
